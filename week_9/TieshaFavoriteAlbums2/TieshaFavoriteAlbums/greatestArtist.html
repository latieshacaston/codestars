    <p>Stevie Wonder has been a recording artist since my grandmother was 12. I was first introduced to him by my grandfather, who used to make mixtapes for me when I was a kid. As I grew older, I started to explore his music more on my own and gained a better appreciation and love for him. Wonder has a beautiful voice and an amazing talent, playing the piano, the harmonica, bongos, the organ, and more. His music is classical and transcends time. </p>
    <p>Stevie Wonder's legacy will stand forever. He has won the most grammy awards for a solo artist of all time, has sold over 100 Million records, has been inducted into the Rock And Roll and Songwriters Hall of Fame and is the second black person to win an academy award for Best Song. He is a legend. </p>
