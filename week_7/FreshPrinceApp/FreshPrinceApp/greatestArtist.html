    <p><b>There is a huge space in my heart for all of my favorite television shows growing up. The Fresh Prince ran from 1990 - 1996. From when I was 2 to 8. So I dont think I ever caught an episode as it originally aired. Instead, I fell in love with it through syndication. Its a show that Ill love forever, and whose episodes Ive watched multiple times.   </b></p>
